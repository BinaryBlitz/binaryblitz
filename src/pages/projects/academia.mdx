about: |
  We made an app where users can look through the menu and place orders for delivery. The user enters the address, selects delivery time and pays the order with a credit card. Built-in bonus system stimulates repeated orders and attracts new customers.

  We created a flexible order distribution system between restaurants of the chain. Depending on the delivery address order is sent to the nearest restaurant and switches to the optimal courier. This optimizes delivery costs and reduces order lead time.
